<!--
    Including/Excluding Test Groups

        Rules:

       No include + no exclude            -       All test methods are run.
       Include name = "regression"        -       Only test methods in the "regression" group will be executed.
       Include name = "smoke" + "system"  -       Only test methods in the "regression" OR in the "smoke" groups are executed.
       Exclude name = "regression"        -       All test methods are run except for those in the "regression" group.
       Include name = "regression" +
        excludde name = "defects.*"       -       All tests methods which belong to the "regression" group AND are not included
                                                    in the "defects.*" group will be executed. If a test is part of the
                                                    "regression" group AND is also part of the "defects" group, will not
                                                    be executed.
